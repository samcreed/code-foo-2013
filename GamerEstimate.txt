Question:
How many gamers are in the San Francisco Bay Area? Describe each step in your thought process.

Answer:
According to Wikipedia, there are 7.15 million people in the Bay Area.

According to IGN, there are an estimated 211 million Americans who play video games. There are about 314 million people in the USA, which means about 67% of the population plays video games, on average. Since San Francisco is such a hip city, let's round that up to 70%.

That calculates to about 5 million gamers in the San Francisco area. I think this must be a very generous upper bound though, incuding non-traditional gamers certainly. A more realistic percentage is probably closer to 35%, which gives a more reasonable 2.5 million.
